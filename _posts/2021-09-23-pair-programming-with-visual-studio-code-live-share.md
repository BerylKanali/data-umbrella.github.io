Pair programming is an amazing experience. On one hand, you and your coding partner can accomplish much more than you would working separately. On the other hand, both can learn new things about the language or framework you are working on from one another. But, mainly, solving problems and coding challenges with somebody else is a lot of fun :).

This document aims to introduce the Visual Studio Code extension Live Share, which allows you to collaborate with coding buddies in real time.

## Live Share
Live Share is an extension from Visual Studio Code that allows you to collaboratively edit and debug with others in real time. It allows you to instantly share your current project, edit snippets of code at the same time or follow someone's cursor while they program.
These are extremely helpful when you are pair-programming using the driver-navigator technique. While the driver codes, the navigator can observe, check other sources or suggest changes.

## Installation
To install Live Share follow these steps:
If needed, install Visual Studio Code.
Download and install the Visual Studio Live Share extension for Visual Studio Code. Use the extensions tab in Visual Studio Code (Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for Live Share.
