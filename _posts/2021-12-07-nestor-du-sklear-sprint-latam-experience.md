I do not remember when I started to be part, but since a friend of mine shared me the open source philosophy and movement I started to be part and colaborate in different ways. Nowadays I am not an active colaborator for any initiative but I always try to help when is possible. But this post is not about how I started whit the open source at least not at all.
